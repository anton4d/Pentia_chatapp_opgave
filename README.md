# Pentia App

## Tasks
0. **Setup with Firebase + React Native**  
- This took my whole Monday, since Firebase did not like that I was using a fresh Google account. No online resource clearly explained that it needed Google Cloud, in a way that made me understand I had to open Google Cloud and activate it.  

1. **Splash Screen**  
- This task did not take too much time. I spent about 3 hours on it.  

2. **Login Screen**  
- Google and Facebook APIs took some time to get underway. The biggest hiccup was that Facebook has changed their whole platform to Meta. No introduction to their software explains the change, so finding the right spot for the hash key was a struggle.  

3. **Chat Rooms**  
- Firebase Realtime Database is awesome. I hadn’t tried fiddling with it before, but it’s extremely responsive and integrates nicely.  

4. **Open Chat Room**  
- Not a problem. This is the room where most of my CSS skills came in. I probably should have made more of an effort on the login screen, but I prioritized functionality over looks for now. I have Friday to refine it.  

5. **Send and Receive Messages**  
- Sending and receiving messages gave me a bit of a headache since I mixed subscribing to the element and manually loading the messages, which caused duplicate messages at one point—not my smartest move. But both sending images and messages work fine now.  

6. **Push Functionality**  
- I skipped this at first because I was working on the Realtime Database and wanted to play with Firebase Storage.  
- After getting back to it, it took most of my sanity—if not all of it. Initially, I tried it with Notifee, but they don’t work well together. Then the Firebase function I pushed stopped working for some reason, which I still don’t know.  
- But now it works, and the user even gets a little bell icon that changes color.  

## Video  
The video should showcase what the app can do.

## Verdict  
I am not satisfied with what I have made. I want to change all of this, but there is no more time.  

- Make a better login.  
- Rename components so they have a more cohesive naming scheme.  
- Clean the chatroom screen; there is way too much stuff going on, and I think I can simplify it.  
- Faster development: now that I have a better foundational knowledge of Firebase, I feel like I can make it much better if I try again.
